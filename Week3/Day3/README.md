## Steps Followed


-	Added error handlers in FLask

-   Installed CORS:
```
pip install flask-cors
```
-   Imported CORS
-   Added fetch function and mentioned 
```
fetch("http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks")
```
-   Run the FLask app using 
```
Python app.py
```
- Also launch React App:
```
npm start
```
-   Check for responses and errors in postman or browser
-   Perform GET,POST,PUT,DELETE and
